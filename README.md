# LDPC Decoding Algorithms Implementation

## Descripton:
This project implements decoding algorithms for Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, focusing on hard-decision decoding techniques. It includes:

* Multi-pass majority decoding.
* Bit-flip decoding algorithm.
* Tools for generating parity-check matrices with circulant block structure.

The project is designed for educational and research purposes, allowing users to simulate and analyze the performance of LDPC codes in noisy communication channels.
